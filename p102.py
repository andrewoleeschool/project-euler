# Three distinct points are plotted at random on a Cartesian plane, for which -1000 â‰¤ x, y â‰¤ 1000, such that a triangle is formed.

# Consider the following two triangles: A(-340,495), B(-153,-910), C(835,-947) X(-175,41), Y(-421,-714), Z(574,-645)

# It can be verified that triangle ABC contains the origin, whereas triangle XYZ does not.

# Using triangles.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 27K text file containing the co-ordinates of one thousand "random" triangles, find the number of triangles for which the interior contains the origin.
